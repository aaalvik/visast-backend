This project was part of my master thesis at University of Bergen, where I developed the tool visAST and examined the usefulness of the tool when used in teaching. This repository contains the backend of the project, a Haskell server. The frontend can be found here: [visAST frontend](https://github.com/aaalvik/visast-frontend).

## visAST
visAST is a visualisation tool for visualising abstract syntax trees (ASTs). The tool is used to visualise expressions of a given grammar, represented as ASTs. The tool can also visualise the evaluation steps produced by a small-step evaluator.
